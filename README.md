# Huffman-Code-Generator
A series of files that utilize trees, stacks, maps, iterators, and a heap queue to compress text using huffman coding. a map is filled with each character in the string as well as how often they occur. This is used to compress the string into binary, which can be used with the serialized tree to decompress the information into the original text.
